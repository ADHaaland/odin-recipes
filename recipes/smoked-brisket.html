<h3>Classic Texas BBQ beef brisket with Black bark</h3>
<p>This Texas BBQ smoked brisket recipe uses Hardcore Carnivore Black Rub and coarse black pepper to create a flavorful, dark bark, slow-cooked to tender perfection at 250°F for 11-14 hours. After wrapping in BBQ paper and resting, it’s sliced against the grain for a classic, melt-in-your-mouth experience. </p> 
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 x 14-16 lb packer cut whole brisket</li>
    <li>Hardcore Carnivore Black rub</li>
    <li>Coarse Black Pepper</li>
    <li>Coarse Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a smoker or pellet grill to 250f. </li>
    <li>Trim fat cap of brisket to 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
    <li>Season the brisket agressively with Black (meaning, use A LOT of seasoning!) on both sides. Add some additional coarse black pepper to the fat cap side to help create the bark. </li>
    <li>Place the brisket fat side up into the smoker, and cook for 7-8 hours. You can spritz it occasionally during this time using a mix of 3:1 water and worcestershire sauce.</li>
    <li>Once the internal temperature reads 165-170 degrees, remove the brisket from the smoker and wrap tightly in BBQ paper to form a parcel.</li>
    <li>Return wrapped brisket to smoker for another 4-6 hours until internal temp reads 203-207 degrees. </li>
    <li>Remove brisket from the smoker, and allow it to cool for 15-20 minutes, still wrapped. Then place into a yeti cooler to rest for at least two hours.</li>
    <li>Slice against the grain to serve.</li>
</ol>
