    <h3> Double smoked ham </h3>
    <p>This double smoked ham recipe enhances a pre-cooked ham with rich, smoky flavor at 250°F, finished with a glossy coat of Hardcore Carnivore Burnt Ends Sauce for a succulent, crowd-pleasing dish. Cooked for 20 minutes per pound until 140°F, it’s simple yet packed with bold taste.</p>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 x cooked (smoked ham), preferably skin off</li>
    <li> Hardcore Carnivore Burnt Ends Sauce</li>
