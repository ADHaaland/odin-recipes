<h3>Butter-basted ribeye steak</h3>
<p> This butter-basted ribeye steak is an indulgent dish that is date night-worthy, perfect for company, and very easy to prepare. Use a high-quality herb butter for the best flavor.</p>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    <li> 1 (1 pound) rib eye steak</li>
    <li> salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
    <li> 2 Tablespoons garlic and herb salted butter (such as KerrygoldÂ®), plus more for serving (optional)</li>
    
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>

<ol>

    <li>Remove steak from package, pat dry, and place on a plate. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 2 hours before cooking.</li>
    <li>Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sprinkle steak thoroughly with salt and pepper. Trim off any extra fat from steak. Place steak in skillet with fattest side down; cook until fat is browned, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking until steak is browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Add butter to skillet and cook until butter is browned. Turn steak over and cook, basting with browned butter, for 2 minutes more. Remove from skillet to a plate. Tent with foil, and rest steak for 7 minutes to absorb juice. Serve steak with a pat of butter.</li>
</ol>
